--methods--
---------------------------------------------------------
 func (sr *Router) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
 ---------------------------------------------------------
-''func'': This keyword is used to define a function in Go.
-''(sr *Router)'': This is the method receiver. It specifies 
 that the ServeHTTP function is a method of the type *Router.
 In Go, methods are functions that are associated with a specific type. 
 Here, *Router is a pointer to the Router type.
-''ServeHTTP'': This is the name of the method. In this case, it's ServeHTTP.
-''(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)'': These are the function parameters. 
 The ServeHTTP method takes two parameters: w, which is an http.ResponseWriter 
 and r, which is an *http.Request. These parameters are used to handle the HTTP 
 response and request objects, respectively.

When a method is defined with a receiver, you can call it on an instance of the
 receiver type. For example, if you have a variable myRouter of type *Router,
  you can call the ServeHTTP method on it like this:
---------------------------------------------------------
myRouter := &Router{} // Assuming Router is a struct type
myRouter.ServeHTTP(responseWriter, request)
---------------------------------------------------------



--requests--
  For every incoming request, we'll need to do the following:
-Extract HTTP method and URL path from the request
-Check if any routes exist that match the method and path
-Invoke the route if there is a match
-Return a 404 if no match is found
